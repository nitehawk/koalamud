# This is the BitKeeper configuration for this package.

# Please take a minute to fill it out carefully, it needs to be accurate.

# NOTICE: you really do want to fill this out, if something goes wrong

# 
# BitKeeper can maintain a log of your change comments (not your source,
# just the comments) on a centralized server.  This is useful as your
# project grows, it gives people a place to go see what is happening on
# a per project basis.  This is especially useful for distributed developers.

# Open Logging server.  This site is where users go to see the
# ChangeSet comments for all instances of this repository.  This must
# be logging@openlogging.org for usage under the terms of the BKL,
# "bk help bkl" will show you the default licensing terms.  If this
# repository is commercial it can be an internal email address or "none"
# to disable logging.
# 
logging: logging@openlogging.org
# You do not have a license for BitKeeper and the logging field in the
# BitKeeper/etc/config file is not set to "logging@openlogging.org".
# You either need a commercial license (to run without open logging),
# or you need to convert your package to single user, or you need to
# configure your package to use openlogging.  Until you have done one of
# those, you may not create any changesets.
# 
# You can get a temporary license by sending a mail request
# to sales@bitmover.com.

# It is very important that this email address is filled out and accurate.

# want), we will contact this email address for confirmation that you really
# did want open logging.  If the email address is inaccurate and we get no
# response from anyone else at your location after 90 days, then open logging
# will be implicitly approved.

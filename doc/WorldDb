World Database General information

Unlike most muds that use a simple room number to reference the 'rooms' in the
game, KoalaMud uses a 3D coordinate system.  These coordinates work just like
they would in the real world, with latitude, longitude, and elevation.  The
benefit to this system is that components such as wilderness can be "sparse
saved" without any significant challenge.  It also allows flexibility in area
creation - Doors/paths to other rooms can be selected from a list of existing
nearby rooms, or specified with absolute coordinates, depending on how its
desired.

The range for all three coordinates is between -2,147,483,648 and
2,147,483,647.  This yields the maximum number of rooms to be well over 70
quadrillion billions (4,294,967,294^3).  At any rate, more then enough room
for your game, no matter how big you make it....


Specifics:
The KoalaMud database backend uses MySQL.  It may be possible to use
postgresql, oracle, and a couple other backends with minimal work as well.

Create a database for your game system in mysql:
create database koalamud;

Grant all privileges on this database to a user for the game:
grant all privileges on koalamud.* to koalamud@localhost identified by 'moo';

Update database.cpp with the appropriate hostname, username, password, and
database name.  The game server will take care of building all of the tables
it needs on its first bootup.

/**  Memory Pool Allocator
 *
 * @author Matthew Schlegel <nitehawk@koalamud.org>
 *
 * Pool based memory allocation class to be used in overloaded new/delete
 * operators.  Provides low overhead allocation/deallocation by allocating
 * large chunks of memory for fixed size class groups.
 *
 * This implementation manages multiple memory pools with varying sizes.  Pool
 * selection is based on requested block size so that objects of the same size
 * will share a single pool.  There is a small amount of overhead required for
 * each pool managed in order to provide locking around pointer updates and
 * the memory overhead to track free blocks in each pool.  We use the memory
 * we allocate for the pool for most of the tracking, but we do allocate a
 * chunk of memory separately to track the first free node of each pool.
 *
 * Both alloc's and free's need to lock the affected pool before updating
 * pointers.  Failure to lock pools before updating could have a devistating
 * effect in KoalaMud's multithreaded environment.
 *
 * New pools are allocated on demand based upon the following criteria:
 * a) There is no existing pool with large enough blocks
 * b) There are pools with big enough blocks, but the overhead in using those
 * blocks is greater then 25%
 *
 * Block sizes for automatically allocated objects may be adjusted slightly to
 * make a better fit into the memory that will be allocated for it.  There
 * will most likely be blocksizes that can't be adjusted without significant
 * overhead.  Those block sizes will most certainly leave extra room in the
 * pool that we will attempt to fill with blocks from a smaller pool.
 *
 * There is a bit of overhead involved in allocating a new pool or starting a
 * block size on an exiting pool, but that overhead is only required on the
 * first allocation of a block size or when the block needs to be expanded.
 * These large block allocations include malloc'ing the block of memory for
 * the calculated block size, and walking through the block to stamp next
 * pointers through it.  For new pools, it is also necessary to create the
 * mutex controlling access to a block.  When adding a new allocation size to
 * an existing pool (120 byte allocations would use the same pool as 128 byte
 * allocations typically), the pool structure will have a pointer to the real
 * pool structure and a counter.
 *
 * The allocator also keeps an allocation counter for each block size so that
 * we can see how memory is being used.  This information is also used to
 * manually force specific pool sizes for heavily used object sizes.  There
 * is also a counter that tracks the largest number of blocks available for a
 * given memory size.
 *
 * @Note  We automatically allocate a pool of 20 byte blocks during
 * construction.  We use the beginning of this block to put all of our
 * tracking overhead in.
